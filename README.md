Hands-on sketchbook, image bank, and presentation slides.

### Hands-on sketchbook

The directory `handson` is incomplete. It already contains a visual frontend and some of the genetic-algorithm related routines.

The following routines will be implemented during the hands-on session:

  - `random_individual()`, generates new individual from scratch
  - `draw_individual()`, aka produce the "phenotype"
  - `mutate()`, one of the genetic "operators"
  - `create_child()`, another genetic operator

### Image bank

The directory `bank` contains images of eyes, noses and mouths. New images can be downloaded from the web and simply saved into this folder to be made available for the program. However, all images must start either with the word "eye", "nose", or "mouth" in order to be found by the program.
