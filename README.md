Interactive Genetic Algorithm in Processing (Python mode)


## Contents

This branch contains the hands-on sketchbook, presentation slides and image bank.

### Hands-on sketchbook

The directory `handson` is incomplete. It already contains a visual frontend and some of the genetic-algorithm related routines.

The following routines will be implemented during the hands-on session:

  - `random_individual()`, generates new individual from scratch
  - `draw_individual()`, aka produce the "phenotype"
  - `mutate()`, one of the genetic "operators"
  - `create_child()`, another genetic operator
